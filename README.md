# rust-mongo-web-api

Rust | Actix Web | MongoDb | Integration tests | Node Test Runner | In-memory MongoDb.

## Introduction

When I got some free time after years of workload, I made a bit of reflection to understand where I am and what I want. Last years were spent on different modern startups, usually with a blend of NodeJS, AWS, MongoDb and React/Flutter. But seasons changes, and I am not getting younger. With rememberance of university education and my passion of old-school development, I've decided to switch my career to Rust development.

This project, being a first transition step, is an analysis of Actix web framework and ways to enhance development with it.
